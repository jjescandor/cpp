1. Stack Memory
    - In C++, programmer has control over the memory and lifecycle of every variable. 
    - By default, every variable in C++ is placed in stack memory.
    - Every C++ variable has four things:
        - A name
        - A type
        - A value
        - A location in memory ("memory address")
        - In C++, the & operator returns the memroy address of a variable as demonstrated [here](./addressOf.cpp).
    - Stack memory is associated with the current function and the memory's lifecycle is tied to the function.
    - When the functions returns or ends, the stack memory of that function is released.
