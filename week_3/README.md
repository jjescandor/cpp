1. Class Constructors
    - When an instance of a class is created, the class constructor sets up the initial state of the object.
    - C++ has an Automatic Default Constructor. If we do not provide any custom constructors, the C++ compiler provides an automatic default constructor for our class for free!
    - The automatic default constructor will only initialize all member variables to their default values.
